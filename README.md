Currently pursuing my MS in Computer Science at UC Riverside and exploring how AI can make the world a smarter place.

Before grad school, I spent two years at ZS Associates, building AI/ML workflows that helped Fortune 500 companies turn mountains of data into real business impact. Along the way, I also got my hands deep into research â€” working on self-supervised learning, segmentation models, and computer vision for medical imaging.

These days, I'm diving into embodied agents, teaching AI how to move, think, and act in dynamic environments. Always building, always learning!
